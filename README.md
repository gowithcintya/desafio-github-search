# GitHub Search Challenge

The project challenge involves creating an Android app that stores a GitHub user (provided at the initial screen) and lists all their public repositories, ensuring the username is saved and the app can reset this information.

The project was started from a fork of the repository made available by the DIO instructor, and some customizations were applied such as:

- Layout customization: button, edit text, texts, and RecyclerView items;
- Implementation of a ProgressBar for loading the repositories after the user is searched;
- Toast that informs of an error in the search (user not found);
- The `openBrowser()` method that allows the user to open the repository in the browser.
